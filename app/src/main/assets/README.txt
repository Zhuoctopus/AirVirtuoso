MediaPipe Hand Landmarker Model File

To enable hand detection in the app, you need to download the hand_landmarker.task model file.

Download from:
https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/hand_landmarker/hand_landmarker/float16/1/hand_landmarker.task

After downloading:
1. Rename the downloaded file to: hand_landmarker.task
2. Place it in this folder (app/src/main/assets/)
3. Rebuild the app

The app will work without this file, but hand detection features will be disabled.
You can still use pose detection features.
